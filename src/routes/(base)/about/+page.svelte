    Hi, I'm eightfold! A fair amount of people have asked me to make a blog,
    and I finally have. If you don't know me, I'm mainly a C/C++ programmer
    who works on some...
    <a 
      href="https://github.com/8ightfold/headless-compiler"
      target="_blank"
      rel="author external noopener"
    >"insane"</a> 
    projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    The point of this blog is threefold:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Document and break down parts of my projects.</li>
    <li>Get up to speed with modern web frameworks.</li>
    <li>Test the various design ideas I come up with.</li>
  </ul>

    There are a lot of "corporate-style" websites today, generally made with
    templates, aiming to look as clean and modern as possible...
  </p>
  <p style="font-size:24px;">And I don't like it.</p>
  <p>
    While it's great if you're running a business, it's not for a personal site.
    That is the one place where you absolutely should be adding character.

    This site was made in a late 90's/early 00's style, as that was what
    I saw growing up (though, even then it was going out of fashion).

    And although this <i>is</i> in a retro style, I used Svelte and modern CSS.

  #block {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;

    overflow: visible;
  }

  p {
    max-width: 70%;
    margin-left: 15%;
    text-align: center;
  }

  ul {
    max-width: 70%;
    margin-left: 15%;
    text-align: center;
    padding-left: 0;
  }

  @media (320px < width <= 860px) {
    h1 {
      font-size: 24px;
    }
		p {
      max-width: 100%;
      margin-left: 10%;
      margin-right: 10%;
      padding-left: 0;
    }

    ul {
      max-width: 100%;
      margin-left: 10%;
      margin-right: 10%;
    }
	}

  @media (width <= 320px) {
    h1 {
      font-size: 16px;
    }
		#block {
      font-size: 12px;
    }
